-Review API for naming consistency and "appropriateness"
-Better docs (finish commenting methods so all will work with jsdoc-toolkit, flesh out README more, add FAQ?)
-Create display type for durations (events with 'end' datetime values)
-Accept XML
-Buffer JSON/XML AJAX data, abstracted by model class
-Adjust timelines so other timelines (other than just scaler view widget) can be integrated and will scale accurately
-Review configuration to see what else needs to be exposed, and add it


DD: bugs horizontal positioning: 05/05/10
-------------------------------------------------------
- why do I need to have a huge width for decades row in order for divs not to wrap--seems like it's far greater than total width of divs?
- initial positioning isn't synced; bottom (years) row seems pretty good, but top (decades) not so much. 
- 'position: absolute;' in .marker throws things off; while with that turned off syncing is not completely terrible (but still off), with that on, it's totally whacked out.
- scaler's re-size handles seem to stop registering in handler after initial "pull"...wtf?
- images for scaler background and 'density' event icons need to be re-generated? (Brett)
- CSS tweaks my programmer self is not aware of (Brett), and also, sorry Brett for my ugly ass timeline.css mangling.  It works, but maybe not so elegantly...

There is probably other stuff I'm forgetting too.


05/06/10 -from Kurt
----------------------------------------
-new hyperstudio logo?
-layout/text/etc. for timeline demo


05/13/10 -EDITS AND TWEAKS FOR PRESENTING DEMOS AT CONFERENCE
----------------------------------------
-Examine color choices/highlighting/etc. with Brett for best possible look, feel and interactivity
* -Ask Brett about de-emphasizing the 'manager' column's items that are not highlighted in scaler
-Horizontal layout: remove scrolling event list until we have time to think of better paradigm, but keep tag cloud, and perhaps add pop-up events?


05/25/10 -FIXES I'M REALIZING I NEED TO DO FOR OTHER TIME PERIODS TO WORK RIGHT
----------------------------------------
-Configurability of time format (labeling) so that it looks right in different configurations.
-Merging multiple data streams into one?  How to do?  Would like to allow one data stream per timeline column as well as multiple data streams per timeline column...hmm...
