-Review API for naming consistency and "appropriateness"
-Better docs (finish commenting methods so all will work with jsdoc-toolkit, flesh out README more, add FAQ?)
-Create display type for durations (events with 'end' datetime values)
-Accept XML
-Buffer JSON/XML AJAX data, abstracted by model class
-Adjust timelines so other timelines (other than just scaler view widget) can be integrated and will scale accurately
-Review configuration to see what else needs to be expose, and add it
