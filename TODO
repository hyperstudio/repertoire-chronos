-Review API for naming consistency and "appropriateness"
-Better docs (finish commenting methods so all will work with jsdoc-toolkit, flesh out README more, add FAQ?)
-Create display type for durations (events with 'end' datetime values)
-Accept XML
-Buffer JSON/XML AJAX data, abstracted by model class
-Adjust timelines so other timelines (other than just scaler view widget) can be integrated and will scale accurately
-Review configuration to see what else needs to be expose, and add it


MAKING TIMELINE HORIZONTAL: DD & BB Notes 05/02/10

- variable for making timeline horizontal, where does it need to go?  Where *isn't* it?  Will be called "orientation."

- column 'width' / 'height'

- make sure we account for height being 0 when we shift orientation to horizontal vs. vertical

- we need to set the dimension that we are not oriented to to 100%
  that is, if width, we set height for any given column to be 100%
  if height, width needs to be 100% - 100% of enclosing div, that is.

- sub-tiles are same as tiles.

- for events: left switches to top, top switches to left.
