-Review API for naming consistency and "appropriateness"
-Better docs (finish commenting methods so all will work with jsdoc-toolkit, flesh out README more, add FAQ?)
-Create display type for durations (events with 'end' datetime values)
-Accept XML
-Buffer JSON/XML AJAX data, abstracted by model class
-Adjust timelines so other timelines (other than just scaler view widget) can be integrated and will scale accurately
-Review configuration to see what else needs to be expose, and add it


MAKING TIMELINE HORIZONTAL: DD & BB Notes 05/02/10
-------------------------------------------------------
*means Dave thinks it's taken care of, more or less:

* - variable for making timeline horizontal, where does it need to go?  Where *isn't* it?  Will be called "orientation."

* - column 'width' / 'height'

* - make sure we account for height being 0 when we shift orientation to horizontal vs. vertical

* - we need to set the dimension that we are not oriented to to 100%
  that is, if width, we set height for any given column to be 100%
  if height, width needs to be 100% - 100% of enclosing div, that is.

* - sub-tiles are same as tiles.

* - for events: left switches to top, top switches to left.


DD: bugs horizontal positioning: 05/05/10
-------------------------------------------------------
- why do I need to have a huge width for decades row in order for divs not to wrap--seems like it's far greater than total width of divs?
- initial positioning isn't synced; bottom (years) row seems pretty good, but top (decades) not so much. 
- 'position: absolute;' in .marker throws things off; while with that turned off syncing is not completely terrible (but still off), with that on, it's totally whacked out.
- scaler's re-size handles seem to stop registering in handler after initial "pull"...wtf?
- images for scaler background and 'density' event icons need to be re-generated? (Brett)
- CSS tweaks my programmer self is not aware of (Brett), and also, sorry Brett for my ugly ass timeline.css mangling.  It works, but maybe not so elegantly...

There is probably other stuff I'm forgetting too.
